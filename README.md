# MazeSolver

This is a simple path-finding visualizer I did in C#.
It first randomly generates a solvable maze, and then uses one of several path-finding algorithms to find the exit.
Every step of both parts is visualized by a simple GUI.

Currently implemented:

 - Breath-First-Search
 - Depth-First-Search
